			"<strong>Hi, my name is Bryanna</strong>, and I am a full-stack engineer with a passion for creating beautiful, intuitive, and scalable digital experiences. I blend my background in UI and UX research with modern engineering practices to bring thoughtful products to life.",
			"I bring more than eight years of experience across design, user research, web development, and full software engineering. My journey began with UI and UX research paired with marketing studies, which shaped how I think about users and the stories digital products tell.",
			"I expanded that foundation at Washtenaw Community College, where I earned hands-on training and certifications in Web Design and Development. I worked deeply with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WordPress, and PHP, and realized I wanted to build products that combined strong design with clean engineering.",
			"My career grew through marketing management and web design roles before evolving into full software engineering positions. Over time, I gained experience building responsive, accessible, and high-quality interfaces across a variety of industries. My work today focuses on modern frontend development using React, TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind, and component-driven architectures.",
			"I specialize in translating high-fidelity concepts into production-ready experiences with a focus on scalability, performance, and design systems. I love creating interfaces that feel intentional, polished, and human, supported by clean code and thoughtful engineering patterns.",
			"I am currently open to mid-level and senior UI and Frontend Engineering opportunities where I can contribute to impactful products and collaborate with teams who value quality, creativity, and strong execution."
